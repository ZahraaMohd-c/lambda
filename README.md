# Project 4: Lambda

## Introduction 

The project is a  Django mathematics-focused discussion platform designed to provide students and enthusiasts with a collaborative space to share knowledge, solve problems, and discuss mathematical concepts. Unlike traditional forums, this platform integrates LaTeX support through MathJax, allowing users to format complex equations clearly in both posts and replies.
